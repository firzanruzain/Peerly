## üìñ About the Project

This project is developed as part of the **Student Lifestyle** track of Codenection 2025.  
We have chosen to address the following problem statement:

> **Background:**  
> Many students struggle with academic challenges, including difficulty understanding course material, limited access to personalized help, and inefficient study habits.

> **The Problem:**  
> Traditional tutoring services are often expensive, inconvenient, or unavailable outside of fixed hours, leaving students without adequate support when they need it most. This gap hinders academic performance, increases stress, and discourages independent learning.

Our platform aims to bridge this gap by providing an accessible, peer-powered ecosystem for academic support.  
Key features include:

- A subject-centric Q&A and notes-sharing system
- Community-driven moderation and subject curation
- Verified tutor and contributor badges
- Study tips, difficulty ratings, and analytics to foster active participation
- A robust tagging and notification system to ensure content discoverability and engagement
- Support for both subject-specific and general questions to cater to diverse academic needs

By tackling this problem, our goal is to create a dynamic learning environment that bridges gaps between students, tutors, and resources‚Äîenhancing educational outcomes and fostering a strong academic community.

_Please refer to the rest of this README for setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and a detailed system flow._
